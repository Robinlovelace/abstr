# Getting started

## Installing R

To generate new scenario files to import into A/B Street with the `abstr` R package, you need to have installed a stable version of [Rstudio and R](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).

## Installing A/B Street


## Installing Rust and the development version of A/B Street

-   Install a stable version of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

    -   On Windows, you will also need [Visual Code Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Visual Studio c++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) prior to installing Rust.

-   On Linux, run `sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libpango1.0-dev libgtk-3-dev` or the equivalent for your distribution.

-   Download the A/B Street repo `git clone https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet.git`

-   Fetch the minimal amount of data needed to get started `cargo run --bin updater -- --minimal`

# Projects supporting `abstr`

Several open source R packages enabled the creation of `abstr`.

These include:

-   [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html) for awesome JSON parsing and generation
-   [magrittr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/index.html) for magic `%>%` pipe-command chaining
-   [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) for simple feature support
-   [tibble](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/index.html) for strict data-frame declaration
-   [tidyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/index.html) for all things data cleaning


# Context

To further understand the methods and motivations behind `abstr`, it helps to have some context.
The package builds on the ecosystem of open source software for geospatial data ([FOSS4G](https://foss4g.org/)) and packages such as [`stplanr`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr) for working with transport data in R.
`stplanr` was developed to support development of the the Propensity to Cycle Tool ([PCT](https://www.pct.bike/)), an open source transport planning system for England and Wales.
The PCT [package](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/pct) enables access to the data generated by the PCT project, plus scenario of change modeling (not forecasting) at the origin-destination level, which can provide results at regions, local, route and route network levels.

The PCT provides a range of deterministic scenarios of change, such as `go_dutch` (where cycling levels matches that of the Netherlands), `gender_eq` (where there is equal levels of cycling among Female and Males) and `gov_target` (where cycling levels reflect that of UK government current targets).
An academic [paper](https://www.jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/view/862) on the PCT provides further detail on the motivations for and methods underlying the project.
In 2018 the beasty `stplanr` (sustainable transport planning) package and R journal [article](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-053/RJ-2018-053.pdf) came on the scene, and further provided functions for solving common problems in transport planning and modeling, as well as advocating a transparency in tool usage within the transport planning paradigm.

Finally, on the R side, in 2021 the `od` package was released which provided functions for working with origin-destination data.
A central focus in all of the packages and papers mentioned above is to provide open access transport tools to support data driven transport policies based on an objective and transparent evidence base.
