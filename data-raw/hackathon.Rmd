# Working with origin-destination and activity data to model decarbonisation

In this session we will explore the potential for origin-destination data to be used as a basis for decar

- Live demo with R
- Live demo with A/B Street

- Presentation of a new example dataset
- How can we visualise the data with static maps?
- How can we visualise the data with animated static maps (e.g. with gganimate)
- How can we visualise the data with animated interactive maps (e.g. with mapdeck)
- How can we model destination switching and working from home?
- How can origin-destination data be used to support decarbonisation research and policy?
